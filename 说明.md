#### 运动

每个身体部位都有自己的体重：蠕动所承受的部分越多，它移动的难度就越大。每个身体部位（除外MOVE）在蠕动移动时产生疲劳点：道路上每个身体部位1个点，平原上2个，沼泽上10个。每个MOVE身体部位每个蜱减少2个疲劳点。当疲劳大于零时，蠕变不能移动。

####控制

新获得的Controller允许您在房间中构建一个spawn。为了构建额外的产卵，道路和扩展，您必须通过使用`Creep.upgradeController`方法将能量泵入控制器来升级房间控制器级别（RCL）。

##### Attacking controllers
A Controller cannot be damaged or destroyed. However, a Controller not affected by an upgradeController action will run a downgrade timer losing 20,000 game ticks at RCL 1, or 5,000 game ticks at RCL 2 to 150,000 game ticks at RCL 8. All timers are listed in the StructureController prototype. As soon as its level reaches 0, a Controller becomes neutral, and another player can reclaim it. Make sure that you upgrade your Controllers from time to time to keep their levels!

You can attack another player's controller downgrade timer by applying attackController on it.

##### Raising GCL
Upgrading GCL requires pumping energy into your Controllers – GCL grows in parallel with the level of your Controllers. Any contribution to any of your Controllers affects your GCL, even if the Controller is fully upgraded to the level 8.

Having upgraded your GCL once, you will never lose it. Even after complete fail in the game and loss of all your rooms, your GCL is stored in your account forever. It allows you to respawn at a new place and quickly regain your former glory.

If some day in the future you plan to claim a room that requires a higher GCL than you have, you can still reserve its Controller. Also, reserving a Controller in a neutral room restores energy sources to their full capacity.
